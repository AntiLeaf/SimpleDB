# Writeup for Lab 3

## Describe any design decisions you made.

I implementd a private nested class for IntegerAggregator, because I don't want to use many `if`s.

`Stream` is coooooooooooooool, so I continued to use it again.

## Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

I don't remember I have changed any API. Anyway, I did no modification to the tests, and I have passed all of them.

## Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

I am lazy, so any unnecessary part is left as it is.

## Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.

I did this lab off and on. The total time may be about 6~10 hours.

The debugging is difficult, as there is no good way to output some info freely. Most of the time is spent on debugging.
